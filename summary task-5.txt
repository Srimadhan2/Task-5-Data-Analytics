***** Relationships and Trends*****
1.Gender vs Survival:
Females had much higher survival rates than males.

2.Class vs Survival:
Passengers in 1st class had better survival rates than 2nd and 3rd.

3.Fare vs Survival:
Higher-paying passengers survived more often.

4.Age vs Survival:
Very young children had higher survival chances

*****Observations for each visual*****
1. Histograms
Age distribution is right-skewed. Most passengers are 20â€“40 years old.

2. Boxplots (Fare outliers)
Some passengers paid extremely high fares (outliers)

3.Scatterplots (Age vs Fare, Colored by Survival)
High fare passengers generally survived more.
Survivors are scattered among all age groups but clustered around lower ages.

4.sns.heatmap
Pclass negatively correlates with survival (-0.34).
Fare positively correlates with survival.

5.sns.pairplot
1st class and higher fares are visually associated with higher survival.

6.Correlation Heatmap
Strong negative correlation between Pclass and Survived (-0.34).
Fare is positively correlated with survival.

*****Summary of Findings*****
Females had a much higher chance of survival than males.
1st class passengers had a higher survival rate.
Younger people (especially children) had slightly better chances.
People who paid higher fares had better survival rates.
